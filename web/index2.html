# How to Move

Move takes a mix of concepts proven successful in other programming languages,
simplifies these concepts in the context of non-computer scientists while
avoiding some of the more obscure constructions.

By learning to program with Move you will learn what programming is. A common
misconception about programming is that you learn a language. That's not entirely
false, but what takes time and effort is learning how to *design* programs. So by
learning a simple but yet fully featured language like Move, you minimize the
initial effort required to get up to speed and can dive into the adventure of
software design much earlier, not having to spend too much time thinking about
the language itself.


## Why?

The first thing we must discuss is *"Why should I learn to program computers?"*.
It's a very good question without a single and universally good explanation, so
let's simplify the answer: **To create things**.

Programming is usually a good fit for one or both of the following things:

1. Realizing ideas, like creating a website or a game. Or having the computer
   draw you some graphics based on some data.

2. Simplifying and speeding up otherwise tedious, repetitive work. For instance,
   having the computer walk through thousands of files to find certain sentences.

The tricky part is that programming is by definition abstract and our brains
work best with concrete stuff, like "here's a stone, move it over there".
Just like writing a novel or painting a fictional picture, programming works on
a level above the actual result.

Say we want to make a web site which changes
the color of its background according to the time of day
(for instance dark colors during the night and bright colors during the day), we
need to *visualize the reults* before we start working. Just as the painter
visualizes her motif before drawing it. When we have a good enough picture in
our head of what we want to create it's time to start programming. So, in a way
we work our way from an abstract idea to a concrete result.

And it's fun.

Now, let's get Moving!


## Values and data

A *value* is a piece of information. Something that *does not do anything* but
is rather used by and passed around a program. You can think of a *value* as the
coffee in your coffee cup. There are only five different types in Move.

The first two types of values are *simple values*:

- `5.31` — A number
- `"John"` — A piece of text

The other two value types are so called *compound values* — values which
*hold other values*:

- `[1, 2, 3]` — A list (with three number values)
- `{a:1, b:2}` — An object (with two number members)

*Compound types* can contain any other value, including other *compound types*
which makes these little buggers a very powerful tool.

The fifth kind of value is a special kind of object called *function*:

- `^(a, b){ a + b }` — A function which produces the sum of two numbers


## Organizing values

When you want to keep a value around there's something called a *variable*.
To put a value into a variable, we make up a name for the variable, then use
the *equal sign* (`=`) and finally write our value.

Here we store the value `"Julia"` into a variable called `name`:

    name = "Julia"

Later in our program we can refer to `name` and get the value `"Julia"` back.
For instance, we might output the value of `name` to the screen:
<samp>Julia</samp>

    print name

As the name suggests, a *variable* can *vary*, meaning we can assign any value
to a variable at any time.

For example, if we want our program above to output another name, we
simply assign another value to our `name` variable:

    name = "John"

When we print `name`, "John" is displayed rather than "Julia". Pretty neat, hu?!


## Reusable programs with *functions*

A *function* is a block of code which can be called (or "performed" if you will)
many times. We can put commonly used code inside functions to avoid re-writing
the same thing several times.

*Functions* are actually just *objects* (one of the five kinds of values we
looked at earlier) with the addition of some code attached to it. Here is a simple
function which glues together the text "Hello " with our `name` variable:

    hello = ^{ "Hello "+name }

Earlier we used something called `print` to output values to the screen. `print`
is not magic, but just a simple *function* which knows how to display
values on the screen.

Let's see what happens when we print our `hello` function:
<samp>[Function: hello]</samp>

    print hello

But... What?! Well, we only printed the *function* but we never *called* it, so
our code that glues together text was never run. Let's try it again, but this time
we add two curly brackets at the end of `hello`. This will tell Move to
*call the function*:
<samp>Hello John</samp>

    print hello{}

Functions is a very powerful tool when writing programs.

When creating a function, we can specify *function arguments*, which are
sorrounded by parentheses and put in between the "^" and the "{".
These "arguments" are just like *variables*, but which are only available inside
our function.

Let's add a "title" argument to our `hello` function:

    hello = ^(title = "Mr."){ "Hello "+title+" "+name }

When calling a function you can pass it arguments:
<samp>Hello Ms. John</samp>

    print hello {title: "Ms."}

Notice how we wrote `title = "Mr."` when we created our `hello` function.
This is the *default value* of the "title" argument.

Let's call our function again, but this time we don't specify the "title" argument:
<samp>Hello Mr. John</samp>

    print hello{}

See. `title` represents its *default value* ("Mr.").

For simple functions like our `hello` it might become "clutterish" or generally
cumbersome to write `{title: "Ms."}` every time. In these cases, there's an
alternate way of calling functions: the *shorthand call-style* which gives a
function's arguments *in the order they where defined when creating the function*:
<samp>Hello Ms. John</samp>

    print hello "Ms."

...

*This guide is currently work in progress and will evolve over time*

# Language reference

This is a summary of the Move language and not a complete reference. Please see [the ECMA-262 specification](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-262.pdf) for details.

## Value types

There are five different value types in Move: numbers, text, lists, objects and
functions.

### Numbers

Numbers can be written in either decimal, hexadecimal or octal notation.

- Decimal notation: `1234`, `5.31` or `.8` — Starts with zero or more digits
  (0-9), has an optional dot ("." aka "full stop") followed by zero or more
  digits. The regular expression used by the Move parser to interpret decimal
  numbers is: `/^\d*\.?\d*(?:e[+-]?\d*(?:\d\.?|\.?\d)\d*)?$/i`

- Hexadecimal notation: `0x4d2` or `0x5` — Starts with "0x" and is followed by
  one or more hexadecimal digits (0-9, a-f) where the "alpha digits" (a-f) can
  be written in either lower case, upper case or a mix thereof.
  Only integers can be expressed in "hex" notation.
  Regular expression used by the parser: `/^0x[0-9a-f]+$/i`

- Octal notation: `02322` or `0664` — Starts with "0" and is followed by one
  or more octal digits (0-7). Regular expression used by the parser:
  `/^0[0-7]+$/`

- "Not a number": `NaN` — A special constant
  used to represent an illegal computation or a failed to-number conversion.

The Number type has exactly 18437736874454810627 (that is, 2<sup>64</sup>-2<sup>53</sup>+3) values, representing the double- precision 64-bit format IEEE 754 values as specified in the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic, except that the 9007199254740990 (that is, 2<sup>53</sup>-2) distinct “Not-a-Number” values of the IEEE Standard are represented in ECMAScript as a single special NaN value.

Example:
<samp>1234
1234
1234
true</samp>

    print 1234
    print 0x4d2
    print 02322
    print 1234 == 1234.0


### Text

Text can contain any Unicode characters and is stored as UTF-16 text. A piece of
text is denoted by enclosing quotation marks (" and " or ' and ') with any text except line breaks or (same as the enclosing) quotation marks. Standard
escape sequences (like "\n" and "\t") as well as Unicode
escape sequences ("\u" followed by four hexadecimal digits) can be used to encode any Unicode character into the text, like line breaks. The backslash character ("\") can also be used to escape characters like an embedded quotation
mark.

- Text: `"John"` — A piece of text representing "John"

- Text with Unicode escape sequence: `"John \u2665 Jane"` — A piece of text
  representing "John ♥ Jane"

- Text with embedded quotation marks: `"John aka \"Johnny\""` — A piece of text representing "John aka "Johnny""

- Text with embedded quotation marks wrapped in single quotes: `'John aka "Johnny"'` — A piece of text representing "John aka "Johnny""

Text is internally represented by the `Text` object (an alias for `String`). Adding functions to the
`Text` object's prototype will make that function available to any text value.

Example of calling the built-in <tt>split</tt> function on a piece of text to produce a list of
substrings:
<samp>["Kittens", "are", "cute"]</samp>

    print "Kittens are cute".split(" ")


### Lists and "arrays"

A List (or Array) is a form of compound value which contains other values in a
ordered sequence. Lists are composed by enclosing zero or more values in a square bracket character pair ("[" and "]"), separated by comma characters. Lists can also be created by programmatic composition. The built-in <tt>Array</tt> object's prototype is the prototype used for new lists.

- &nbsp;`["Kittens", "are", "cute"]` — A list containing three pieces of text: "Kittens", "are" and "cute"

- &nbsp;`["Kittens", 123, ["are", "cute"]]` — A list containing three values of different types: some text, a number and another list.

Example of programmatic composition:
<samp>["Kittens", "are", "cute"]</samp>

    list = []
    list.push "Kittens"
    list[1] = "are"
    list[list.length] = "cute"
    print list


### Objects

The Object type is fundamental to Move (and JavaScript) as all other values are in fact Objects. E.g. a Number is a special type of Object. We say that "Move contains five different types of values" which is a simplification. Move has in fact only one type — Object — but at the same time,
the language and the runtime *treats some Object subtypes differently*, like Numbers which can be used for mathematical operations or text which when "added"
together creates a new piece of text being the two texts glued together. Therefore we simplify value types by saying there's only five of them.

An Object is a set of (unique) keys with associated values. Keys must be text values, but an associated value can be of any type. Objects are denoted by a pair of curly brackets ("{" and "}") holding zero or more key-value pairs. Keys are written either as regular text with wrapping quotation marks or without wrapping quotation marks for text which conforms to the rule that it is a valid name (starts with a-z, A-Z, _ or $ and is followed by zero or more letters, numbers, etc). A key is terminated by a colon character and is followed by a value expression. Two successive key-value pairs are separated by a comma character.

- &nbsp;`{a:1, b:2}` — An object with two pairs: Key "a" represents the value 1 and
  key "b" represents the value 2.

Example:
<samp>1
2
undefined
3</samp>

    obj = {a:1, "b-B":2}
    print obj.a
    print obj["b-B"]

### Functions

Functions are denoted by a circumflex accent character ("^") optionally followed by argument declarations wrapped in a parenthesis character pair ("(" and ")"), finally followed by a block of code wrapped in a pair of curly bracket characters ("{" and "}").

The block of code in a function has it's own scope — a variable defined (assigned for the first time) in such a block will "live" in that block, thus any references to that variable *before* the declaration of the code block will
refer to *another*, probably undefined, variable.

The last statement in a function's code block is *returned*. There's also a special "return" keyword which can be used to prematurely return a value from
a function.

Arguments can have explicit default values which are denoted by a postfix assignment operator ("=") for the argument name followed by a value. If no explicit default value is given, the "undefined" atom is used.

- &nbsp;`^(a, b){ a + b }` — A function which produces the sum of two numbers

- &nbsp;`^{ 5 + 7 }` — A function which does not expect any arguments

- &nbsp;`^(a=5, b=7){ a + b }` — A function with default values for its arguments

- &nbsp;<code>^(a, b){ if (a > 4) return a; a + b }</code> — A function which use the "return" keyword to, in some cases, prematurely return a value and stop execution of that function's code.

Here is an illustrating example of how scope works. The following code will yield a reference error with the message "x is not defined" since "x" is defined in the "y" function's scope and is thus not available to the outer scope:
<samp>ReferenceError: x is not defined
...</samp>

    y = ^{ x = 5 }
    y{}
    print x

Here we assign something to x in the outer scope which will tell Move that "x" should live and be available in that (outer) scope:
<samp>5</samp>

    x = 0
    y = ^{ x = 5 }
    y{}
    print x


### Atoms

Move has a set of "atoms" which are basically pre-defined constants with itself as its value. They are called "atoms" since there is only one single, global and immutable instance (or "version" if you will) of each of these special values:

- &nbsp;`undefined` — Means that something is not defined. E.g. A function's argument without an explicit default value will have this atom as its value unless provided during a call to such a function.

- &nbsp;`null` — Means "empty" or "nothing". Handy in the case `undefined` is not suitable (i.e. you have defined a value but it's empty).

- &nbsp;`true` — Represents truth and is the product of a truthy logical comparison (e.g. <code>4 &lt; 6 == true</code>)

- &nbsp;`false` — Represents something being false or "no" and is the product of a false logical comparison (e.g. <code>4 &gt; 6 == false</code>)

Example:
<samp>true
true
true</samp>

    print true != false
    print undefined != null
    Yes = true
    print Yes == true
